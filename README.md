<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is Tic Tac Toe Game, where two players X and O play against each other in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. If both players end up in a grid where there is no winning condition, it is a tie. 

This project is designed for two players or a single player facing against the computer that is powered with Minimax Algorithm.
