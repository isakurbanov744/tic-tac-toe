<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is Tic Tac Toe Game, where two players X and O play against each other in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. If both players end up in a grid where there is no winning condition, it is a tie. 

This project is designed for two players or a single player facing against the computer that is powered with Minimax Algorithm.

## Information

### Minimax Algorithm

Minimax Algorithm is a recursive algorithm for choosing the next move in an n-player game, usually a two-player game. Recursion is required in Minimax Algorithm to create smaller instances of the current tic-tac-toe game.


* Heuristic Function

  Needs Information


* Algorithm Pseudocode
  ```js
    function minimax(node, depth, maximizingPlayer) {
      if (depth = 0) {
          return the heuristic value of node
      }
      if (maximizingPlayer) {
          value = -Infinity
          for (child in node) {
              value = max(value, minimax(child, depth − 1, FALSE))
          return value
        }
      else (minimizing player) {
          value = Infinity
          for (child in node) {
              value := min(value, minimax(child, depth − 1, TRUE))
          return value
        }
      }
    }
  ```
